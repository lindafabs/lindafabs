### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Linda! 
 
 I am a Master student in Electrical and Electronics engineering student @EPFL, with a bachelor degree in Physics engineering obtained from Politecnico di Torino. 
 
 #### Here are some of my current projects : 
 
 Links will be added soon :) 
 
 - [**Semester project**](https://github.com/lindafabs/Semester_Project): investigation on Continuous-time paradigm in Digital Signal Processing and Neural Networks 
 - [**Robust Journey planner**](): Journey planning algorithm on Swiss railway data that is able to estimate the probability of success of a trip using Spark and Hadoop.
 - [**Deezer Social Nerwork analysis and classification**](https://github.com/lindafabs/NML_FinalProject.git): Analysis on a graph theory basis of the Deezer Social Network dataset and binary classification on the gender of the user


 - [**Acoustic OFDM transceiver**](): MATLAB implementation of an OFDM transmission scheme for a microphone-speaker system. 
 - [**IS-95 MIMO/CDMA implementation**](): MATLAB implementation of the IS-95 standard using CDMA protocols on both SISO/MIMO systems.
